MongoDB Scanner

This projecgt is a scanner to find mongodb with remote connection enabled, which is the default setting, but risky as well.

There are two version of scanners.
----mongoScan.py
----mongoScan_multiThreads.py

mongoScan.py
[+]
    Single threads scanner, with instant state output and recoding IPs into a file.
    Usage: mongoScan.py [IpListFile] [OutputFile]
[-]

mongoScan_MultiThreads.py
[+]
    Multiple threads scanner, with finish time estimation. Only output success IPs.
    Usage: mongoScan_multiThreads.py [ThreadsNumber] [IpListFile]
[-]

IpListFile 
    Could be any text file that contains some ip addresses. There is no strict file format limit because I use regex to extract IPs.
    One of the best tools generating host list is nmap, here's how I used it: 
        nmap -sL -oG -n ip.txt 192.168.1.1/16							----Generate a list from a range of IP, without scanning.
		nmap -p27017 -n --open -T4 -sT -oG ip.txt 192.168.1.1/24		----Find 27017(default port for mongoDB) opened IP

ThreadsNumber 
    Decides the speed of the scan. Generally, larger threads number gives faster performance, but setting it too large may cause instablity.
